# C-Sharp LazyTurtle Coding Assignment

This application accepts direction files in .txt format that contain ONLY 3 letters: FBLR

These stand for Forward, Back, Left, and Right. This was done as an exercise posted at https://github.com/janalta/Coding-Exercise (before it said WEB app, that was changed 11 days after the original was given to frustrate late arrivals. (Since there would be no server interaction!)

## Features / Usage

1.It presents a familiar GUI that allows you to select a .txt file containing directions (UDLF) from the File menu and then if you want, you can start the journey right away, or adjust the speed (Laziness) first. (Laziness an be adjusted at any time)

2. The name of the directions.txt file will be shown below and the turtle will use these directions to move around a grid on a highlighted path.

3. It keeps track of each position that overlaps and that location's color changes in real time to a new color each time the turtle passes it and the number of overlapps can be queried at any time by clicking on the real-time number "Passed" in the status bar then "Show Points Passed"

4. The overlaps cause color changes and at the end you can see the full path the turtle traveled and the points with the most overlaps. The turtle paints you a nice little picture.

5. You can adjust the speed of the turtle to see if it's following the directions properly or if you just want to see it finish.

6. It also has a progress bar and shows the number or directions processed at the number remaining to show you how far along it is.

7. It always shows you the current position of the turtle reletive to its starting point coordinates in real time.

## Conclusion

We hope you'll have fun drawing pictures with LazyTurtle and watching her scurry around your screen.

## Bugs

You might have display problems if your Windows scaleing it set really high and everything on your screen is really BIG.
